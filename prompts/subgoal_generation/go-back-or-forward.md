I need your help with an analysis to an action in browser and its related changes.
We recorded a user's interactions with his browser for the current task. His ultimate goal is:

{{ ultimate_goal }}

In the current sub-task, the user clicked on "go back" or "go forward" button of the browser, it is possible that he didn't find the information he needed in the current page, or he may want to 
confirm information in the previous page. This is the information of this action:

{{ action }}

The content before he goes back or forward is:

{{ page_content }}

note that sometimes in the page content, you will see #rme and it means there are more children inside this tag but we hide it for shortening contexts.
You should think about what is the purpose of this action by the user. You don't need to tell me your thought process. You only need to give me a final reply which is a concise and formatted instruction in JSON to make another agent to understand this sub-goal and reproduce the action.
Do not mention "go back" or "go forward" because it is unclear. Tell which URL it should navigate to. e.g.:
{"next_goal": "Navigate to https://www.allrecipes.com/search?q=baked+salmon to review search results for 'baked salmon' recipes on Allrecipes."}
{"next_goal": "Navigate to google.com to search for keywords spanish restaurants."}
