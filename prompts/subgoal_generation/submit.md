I need your help with an analysis to an action in browser and its related changes.
We recorded an action of 'submit' by the user with his browser for the current task. His ultimate goal is:

{{ ultimate_goal }}

So here is the basic information of the action for the 'submit' in current sub-task:

{{ action }}

note that "target" is the targeted element for this action.
Here is the detailed information about the form values that the user submitted:

{{ change_events }}

note that in some "nodeinfo", #rme mean there are more children inside this tag pairs but we hide it for shorting the context.
You should think about what is the purpose of this action by the user, and think about what is the goal this user is trying to achieve in the current sub-task. You don't need to tell me your thought process. You only need to give me a final reply which is a concise and formatted instruction in JSON to make another agent to understand this sub-goal and reproduce the action. Do not mension the details of the target. If the submision is a search, you need to provide two actions, input change and press enter key e.g.:
{"next_goal": "Enter 'Singapore' as the destination in the search input field and press enter key."}
{"next_goal": "Click on the button with text 'Dinners' to view more options for cooking dinners at home"}
